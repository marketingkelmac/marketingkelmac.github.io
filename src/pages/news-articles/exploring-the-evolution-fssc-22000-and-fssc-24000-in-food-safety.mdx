**Introduction** : In the realm of food safety, conformity assessment and certification play a vital role in ensuring the highest standards are upheld across the industry. I recently attended the FSSC 22000 conference in Amsterdam, the Netherlands where I met industry peers and friends in the conformity Assessment and Certification world, Jessica Osborne, Chief Program Officer and Ken Lakenberg, Business Development Manager Eagle Certification, USA. Among these certifications, FSSC 22000 has gained significant recognition and acceptance in the food and beverage industry. However, there is another certification that has been making waves: FSSC 24000. In this blog post, we will delve into the world of food safety management systems, understand the significance of FSSC 22000, and explore the emergence of FSSC 24000. 

  

##The Significance of FSSC 22000 

FSSC 22000, or the Food Safety System Certification 22000, is a robust and globally recognized certification scheme designed for food and beverage manufacturers, and related supply chains. It is unique in that it combines the requirements of ISO 22000:2018, the international standard for food safety management systems, with specific prerequisite programs related to food safety and additional FSSC 22000 requirements aimed at ensuring the highest levels of integrity and assurance in the certification industry. FSSC 22000 provides a comprehensive framework for managing food safety risks and ensures the implementation of effective control measures throughout the food supply chain. 

One of the key advantages of FSSC 22000 is its compatibility with other management system Conformity standards, such as ISO 9001 for Quality Management, ISO 14001 for Environmental Management; ISO 26000 for Social Responsibility etc. This compatibility allows organizations to integrate their food safety management system seamlessly, reducing duplication of efforts and streamlining processes. By obtaining FSSC 22000 certification, organizations demonstrate their commitment to food safety, enhance their reputation, and gain a competitive edge in the market. 

##Introducing FSSC 24000 

 While FSSC 22000 has established itself as a leading food safety certification, at the FSSC June 2023 conference in Amsterdam in the Netherlands, the FSSC has announced the emergence of a new certification scheme: FSSC 24000. This certification builds upon the foundations of FSSC 22000 and expands its scope to address Sustainable Development Goals [SDG] in the food industry, aligning with the United Nations strategy in encouraging countries and organization's SDG goals. FSSC 24000 encompasses food safety management systems and environmental management systems, aligning with ISO 14001 and specifically climate change, clean water and sanitization, affordance and clean energy and social responsibility specifically aimed at achieving zero hunger and food waste respectively. 

  

The primary goal of FSSC 24000 is to promote sustainable practices within and across the food supply chain. It encourages organizations to adopt environmentally responsible methods, reduce waste, conserve resources, and minimize their overall environmental impact. The new FSSC 22004 certification scheme encourages the elimination of food waste, estimated by the United Nations to be in the region of 18% across the food supply chain. By integrating food safety, environmental and social responsible management systems, FSSC 24000 enables organizations to enhance their sustainability credentials, create a meaningful and demonstratable impact on society while maintaining the highest standards of food safety. 

 

##Benefits of FSSC 24000: 

Obtaining FSSC 24000 certification offers numerous advantages for organizations operating in the food industry. Firstly, it demonstrates a commitment to sustainable practices, which aligns with the growing consumer demand for sustainable and eco-friendly products and services. By incorporating environmental management into their operations, organizations can reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to a greener future while reducing the impact on climate change. Finally, and arguably by incorporating the most relevant social management element, it allows organization in the food supply chain to reduce food waste, contribute to zero hunger, and with all three elements combined, deliver on independently verified and societal impact. 

Moreover, FSSC 24000 helps organizations identify and mitigate risks associated with food safety, environmental and social impact. By implementing robust control measures, they can ensure the safety of their products while minimizing adverse effects on the environment and maximizing the impact on society. This comprehensive approach enhances the overall resilience and sustainability of the food supply chain. 

  

**Conclusion**: As the food industry continues to evolve, certifications like FSSC 22000 and FSSC 24000 play a crucial role in driving impact, integrity and assurance. While FSSC 22000 focuses primarily on food safety management, FSSC 24000 expands its scope to include environmental and social management, offering a holistic approach to sustainability in the food sector and aligning with the United Nations and their Sustainable Development Goals. 

By obtaining these certifications, organizations can demonstrate their commitment to food safety, environmental, and social responsibility, and continuous improvement. 

Whether it is FSSC 22000 or FSSC 24000, the goal remains the same: ensuring the safety and integrity of the food supply chain while embracing sustainable practices.
