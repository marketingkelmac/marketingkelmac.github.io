In the world of food safety management systems, there are various standards and certifications that organizations can choose to implement. Two of the most widely recognized standards are ISO 22000 and FSSC 22000. While both standards focus on ensuring the safety of food products, they have some key differences that organizations should be aware of when deciding which one to implement. In this blog post, we will explore what ISO 22000 and FSSC 22000 are, discuss their differences, and provide some guidance on choosing the right standard for your organization. 

##What is ISO 22000 

ISO 22000 is an international standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It provides a framework for implementing a food safety management system that enables organizations to identify and control food safety hazards. ISO 22000 covers the entire food supply chain, from farm to fork, and is applicable to all types of organizations regardless of their size or location. It is based on the principles of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system and incorporates prerequisite programs and management system requirements. 

##What is FSSC 22000 

FSSC 22000, on the other hand, stands for Food Safety System Certification 22000. It is a certification scheme recognized by the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) and is designed specifically for the food and beverage industry. FSSC 22000 combines the ISO 22000 standard with additional requirements, including the ISO/TS 22002-X prerequisite programs for food manufacturers, catering, retail, storage, and transportation, animal feed and foodstuffs and the FSSC additional requirements for food safety management systems associated with FSSC 22000 specific requirements. It provides a more detailed and comprehensive framework for food safety management, tailored specifically for the food and beverage industry. 

##Key difference between ISO 22000 and FSSC 22000 

One of the key differences between ISO 22000 and FSSC 22000 lies in their scope and industry applicability. ISO 22000 is a generic standard that can be applied to any organization in the food supply chain, including primary producers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. On the other hand, FSSC 22000 is specifically targeted at food manufacturers, including caterers, transportation and storage, retail and animal feed, and foodstuffs, and covers a broader range of requirements, such as specific prerequisites and additional controls, which are tailored to the unique challenges of the food and beverage industry. Therefore, if your organization is solely involved in food or beverage manufacturing, transportation and storage, retail, catering, animal feed, and foodstuffs, FSSC 22000 may be the more suitable choice. 

Another significant difference between the two standards is their recognition and acceptance within the industry. ISO 22000 is a globally recognized standard and is widely accepted in both domestic and international markets. It provides a solid foundation for implementing a food safety management system and demonstrates a commitment to ensuring the safety of food products. FSSC 22000, being a GFSI-recognized scheme, carries even greater industry recognition and is often required or preferred by many food retailers and manufacturers. Achieving FSSC 22000 certification can provide organizations with a competitive advantage and enhance their marketability. 

##Which one to choose for your organization 

When choosing between ISO 22000 and FSSC 22000 for your organization, several factors should be considered. Firstly, evaluate the specific requirements of your industry and determine if FSSC 22000's additional controls and prerequisites align better with your organization's needs. Secondly, consider the recognition and acceptance of the standard within your target market. If your customers or industry partners require or prefer FSSC 22000 certification, it may be the more suitable choice. Thirdly, take into account the available resources and expertise within your organization for implementing and maintaining the chosen standard. Fourthly, take into account trust and assurance. While most GSFI schemes offer a degree of assurance, some GFSI Schemes are simply more robust. Finally, take into account the lifetime costs of certification or ownership versus other GFSI schemes.  

In conclusion, ISO 22000 and FSSC 22000 are both valuable frameworks for implementing food safety management systems. While ISO 22000 is a generic standard applicable to all organizations in the food supply chain, FSSC 22000 provides a more specific and comprehensive approach tailored to food manufacturers, retailers, caterers, transportation and storage providers, and animal and feedstuff manufacturers. Consider the scope, industry recognition, and specific requirements of each standard when deciding which one to choose for your organization. By selecting the appropriate standard, you can ensure the safety of your food products, meet customer expectations, regulatory requirements, and United Nations Sustainability Development Goals, and enhance your competitiveness in the market.
