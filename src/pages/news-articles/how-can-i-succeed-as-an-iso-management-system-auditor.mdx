The auditing process constitutes an essential quality control for organizations who have invested time, effort, and resources in gaining and committing to ISO certification both as a differentiator, and per the requirements of state and federal regulations and contractual obligations.

These organizations need verification that the specified ISO systems and related processes are both established per the relevant documentation and are being used as directed. Management needs assurance that the desired results are being achieved and, if not, those areas of underperformance are highlighted, the level of risk determined, and knowledgeable recommendations for remediation and improvement are rendered.

## What are the steps to success for an ISO auditor?

There are three distinct considerations in becoming and excelling at ISO auditing:

1. Understand that this is a people business

   ISO auditing is a field with great opportunity not only to contribute to overall success but to advance your career and earning power. It requires not only interest but commitment. The rules and regulations are codified—it’s the people that make them work or not.

   Becoming a certified internal or lead ISO auditor bestows great responsibility, as well as the opportunity to impact organization integrity, competitiveness, and profitability. It’s an important professional step for those committed to quality management

2. Get the education and certification you need

   There is education and certification required at every level of your career growth. This is the underpinning of your long-term contribution and success.

   ISO auditors must have an in-depth knowledge of the relevant ISO requirements, audit tools, and techniques. There are five entry levels to gaining this knowledge and skill and to help you accelerate your ISO Auditor career via the Kelmac Group® Academy learning pathways. Each learner is unique, and our learning pathways enable you to enter at the appropriate level and progress to the maximum competency and performance level you want to attain.

   - Take a Fundamentals Course that covers the relevant ISO standard and/or Regulatory requirement

   - Successfully complete an internal auditor management system course, obtaining a relevant internationally recognized qualification, e.g., CQI-IRCA, FSSC 22000 etc.

   - Successfully complete a lead auditor course, obtaining a relevant internationally recognized qualification, e.g., CQI-IRCA, FSSC 22000 etc.

   - Successfully complete an auditor conversion or transition course of study, maintaining your Continuous Professional Development

   - Successfully complete an advanced and specialist course of study, obtaining a relevant internationally recognized professional qualification, e.g., CQI-IRCA, ASQ etc.

3. Increase your contribution

   As an ISO Management System Lead Auditor advances through their career, they gain perspective and skills in three important areas:

   - How to balance and reduce an organization’s risk profile while enhancing integrity, performance, and interested party requirements and expectations

   - How to design and accomplish audits per the appropriate ISO and/or regulatory protocols and deliver extra value to management

   - Developing a “sixth sense” for predicting organization insights aimed at reducing organization risks and identifying opportunities aimed at improving organization performance

## How can I get the right start and position myself for success?

The difference in your success begins with your education and how well you understand not only the basic requirements but how to apply audit skills and techniques on the job. The standards for these courses and the requirements for certification are governed by CQI-IRCA, the training certification body. The standards and requirements are fairly straightforward, and several learning organizations offer such courses, imparting just the basics. Often, their Learning consultants have no background in compliance and conformity beyond the classroom.
