An effective internal audit program is essential for ensuring assurance and integrity and continual improvement of a management system. However, many organizations struggle to achieve the desired results from their internal audit program. As a leading ISO training company with over 30 years of experience, we understand the importance of creating, delivering, implementing, and maintaining high-effective management systems and regulatory compliance services. In this blog post, we will address the challenges faced by organizations with ineffective internal audit programs and provide five key changes that can be made to turn this situation around. By implementing these changes, organizations can enhance the assurance, integrity, effectiveness, and overall impact of their management system’s internal audit program.

##Develop objectives for the Internal Audit Program

One of the most significant changes an organization can make to improve its internal audit program is to establish clear and measurable objectives for the management system’s internal audit program with the relevant stakeholders. This involves identifying and assessing the risks and opportunities associated with the management system, statistically examining past internal audit program performance and audit findings, consultation with relevant stakeholders, and aligning the audit activities accordingly. By focusing on areas of higher risk and strategic importance from an assurance and integrity perspective, internal auditors can provide valuable insights and recommendations for improvement.
Implementing objectives for the internal audit program requires conducting a thorough assessment of the current level of assurance and integrity being provided by the organization's internal audit program, defining objectives based on identified risks and opportunities, examining past audit findings and performance, consultation with relevant stakeholders, and prioritizing audit objectives accordingly. This approach ensures that internal audits are targeted, relevant, and address the areas that pose the greatest risks and opportunities to the organization's objectives and compliance obligations.

##Develop a Risk-based Audit Approach

One of the most significant changes an organization can make to improve its internal audit program is to adopt a risk-based audit approach. This involves identifying and assessing the risks and opportunities associated with the management system and aligning the audit activities accordingly. By focusing on areas of higher risk and strategic importance, internal auditors can provide valuable insights and recommendations aimed at improving controls and overall improvement.
Implementing a risk-based audit approach requires conducting a thorough risk assessment, defining audit objectives based on identified risks, and prioritizing audit activities accordingly. This approach ensures that internal audits are targeted, relevant and address the areas that pose the greatest risks to the organization's management system objectives and compliance obligations, including alignment with the organization's overall risk management and governance needs.

##Enhance Auditor Competence and Training 

The competence of internal auditors is critical to the assurance and integrity, and effectiveness of the audit program. Organizations should first identify the high-risk processes, if any, in their organization, the number of internal auditors needed, and the competencies needed by the Internal Auditors, utilizing external Internal Auditors, where required. Invest in auditor training programs, such as those offered by Accredited ISO training companies, to ensure that auditors have the necessary knowledge, skills, and understanding of the management system standards and audit principles, tools and techniques, and ethics expected to be met by the Internal Auditors. Thirdly, internal auditors are not to be assigned to audit high-risk processes if they do not meet the additional competence requirements needed to audit these processes, and also they should be independent of those processes.

Additionally, organizations should establish a formal pool of competent internal auditors, especially when asked to audit high-risk processes within their management system, together with a competency framework for internal auditors, defining the required competencies for different levels of auditors within the organization and processes of high risk. Regular training and continuous professional development opportunities should be provided to auditors to enhance their competence and keep them updated with the latest industry trends, regulatory requirements, and internal audit program objectives and auditee, technical reviewer, and stakeholder feedback.

##Foster an Objective and Independent Audit Environment 

To improve the effectiveness of the internal audit program, organizations must create an objective and independent audit environment. Auditors should be given the freedom to express their findings and recommendations without fear of retribution or bias. Secondly, the organization should establish a robust technical review process for reviewing the level of assurance and integrity of the internal audit.  This required the organization to establish a technical review team to review the audit file presented to them.  The technical review team should have clearly defined and documented criteria, including suitability and adequacy of the (1) audit conclusion statement (2) audit finding(s) including risk classification (3) audit recommendations (4) audit trail documentation (5) the audit file itself and (6) auditor performance feedback.

Implementing a robust audit planning process, assigning auditors with no conflicts of interest, requisite competence, especially for auditing high-risk processes, ensuring the independence of the audit function, and providing auditors with the right environment for conducting audits are crucial steps. Additionally, organizations should establish a robust system for a technical review of each audit, and providing auditors with objective and constructive performance feedback is essential for demonstrating assurance, integrity, and independence of the organization's audit program.

##Promote a Culture of Continuous Improvement 

An effective internal audit program goes beyond compliance checking; it should be viewed as an opportunity for continuous improvement. Organizations should periodically review the performance of the internal auditor program objectives, audit findings by severity, audit finding trends, internal audit technical review analysis, and internal auditor stakeholder feedback, and compare results versus overall organization risk and governance needs.
By fostering a culture of continuous improvement, organizations can transform the internal audit program into a valuable tool for driving internal audit assurance and integrity. Auditors should be encouraged to provide constructive feedback, suggest innovative ideas, and collaborate with process owners to implement improvements identified during audits.  Leadership and top management should establish higher internal audit objectives for the coming financial/calendar year based on lessons learned, risks, and opportunities identified.

An ineffective internal audit program can hinder an organization's ability to achieve its management system objectives, meet regulatory requirements and deliver internal audit assurance and integrity. By implementing changes such as establishing internal audit objectives, adopting a risk-based audit approach, selecting auditors for high-risk processes, enhancing auditor competence, fostering an independent and objective audit environment, and promoting a culture of continuous improvement, organizations can turn their internal audit program into a valuable tool for delivering assurance and integrity, driving excellence and continual improvement. Partnering with experienced Accredited ISO training companies can further enhance the effectiveness of the internal audit program, ensuring that organizations derive maximum value and benefit from their management system audits.
