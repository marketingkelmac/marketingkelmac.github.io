ISO 9001 is an internationally recognized standard that provides a framework for implementing a robust Quality Management System (QMS) within an organization. One of the crucial aspects of ISO 9001 compliance is conducting internal audits to assess the conformity, compliance, effectiveness and efficiency of the QMS. In this blog post, we will explore the main steps involved in ISO 9001 internal audits and highlight their importance in achieving certification and maintaining continuous improvement. 

## Step 1: Establishing the Audit Program: 

The first step in conducting an ISO 9001 internal audit is to establish an audit program. This involves defining the scope, objectives, and frequency of the audits using a process and risk-based approach. The audit program should consider all relevant processes, departments, and functions within the organization. By outlining the audit schedule and allocating resources, the organization can ensure that audits are conducted systematically and effectively and more importantly based upon the performance goals and risks faced within the organization. ISO 19011:2018 also introduced a new requirement, goals should be established to plan and manage the internal audit program and a periodic review should also be in place to ensure the audit program goals are fully met, see section 5 of ISO 19011:2018 

## Step 2: Selecting the Audit Team: 

The audit team plays a pivotal role in the internal audit process. It is essential to select competent individuals who possess a thorough understanding of the ISO 9001 standard and its requirements and especially the high-risk product, technological and management system processes. The team members should be impartial and independent from the processes they will be auditing. Training and certification in ISO 9001 internal audit methodologies further enhance their expertise, ensuring a successful audit. 

## Step 3: Preparing for the Audit: 

Preparation is key to conducting a smooth and effective ISO 9001 internal audit. The audit team should review not only relevant documentation, including the QMS manual, procedures, work instructions, and records by organization performance data. They should also familiarize themselves with the specific processes and activities that will be audited. This step helps the team gain a comprehensive understanding of the organization's QMS and identify areas that may require further scrutiny during the audit. 

## Step 4: Conducting the Audit: 

During the audit, the team will assess the organization's QMS against the requirements of ISO 9001, the needs of the organization, customer requirements and where relevant regulatory requirements. They will examine processes, procedures, records, and relevant product, process and organization performance and evidence to determine compliance and identify areas to improve effectiveness and efficiency. The audit team will conduct interviews with employees, observe work activities, review documentation and records, analyze data and where relevant conduct testing to gather sufficient evidence. It is crucial for auditors to maintain professionalism, objectivity, and confidentiality throughout the audit process. 

## Step 5: Reporting and Corrective Actions: 

After completing the audit, the team prepares an audit report that documents their findings, including any non-conformities or opportunities for improvement. The report should be concise, clear, and provide sufficient evidence to support the conclusions. The audit conclusion section ion of the audit report should include information needed by the relevant stakeholders such as overall conclusion, volume and classification of insights and non-conformities, details of product, process and business performance, compliance with regulatory and customer obligation, effectiveness of change and risk management practices, leadership and management commitment etc. Non-conformities should be clearly identified and categorized based on their severity. The organization can use the audit report as a valuable tool for initiating corrective and preventive actions to address identified issues and improve the QMS. 

## Step 6: Follow-up and Continuous Improvement: 

Following the audit, the organization should conduct follow-up activities to verify the effectiveness of corrections and corrective actions taken. Critically, a review of the effectiveness of corrections and corrective actions should also be undertaken to ensure non-conformities are effectively and efficiently addressed and do not reoccur. This ensures that identified non-conformities have been adequately addressed. Furthermore, the organization should embrace a culture of continuous improvement by using the audit findings to identify opportunities for enhancing the QMS and its performance. Regular internal audits contribute to ongoing improvement efforts and help maintain ISO 9001 certification. 

**Conclusion**: 

ISO 9001 internal audits are an essential component of a successful Quality Management System. By following the main steps outlined above, organizations can effectively assess their QMS, identify areas for improvement, and achieve ISO 9001 certification. These audits promote a culture of continuous improvement, enabling organizations to meet customer expectations, enhance operational efficiency, and drive overall excellence. As organizations strive for quality excellence, ISO 9001 internal audits serve as a valuable tool for ensuring compliance, mitigating risks, and achieving sustainable success.
