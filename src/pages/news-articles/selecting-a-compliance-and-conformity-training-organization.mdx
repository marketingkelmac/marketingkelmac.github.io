**Introduction**: As organizations seek and maintain ISO certification, staying up-to-date with the latest industry standards, audit standards, and technical topics is crucial to select the right Training Organization to ensure your organization and personnel receive the highest quality of training. In this blog, we will discuss some of the key factors in selecting the Training Organization that is right for you and your organization, emphasizing the importance of this update and providing guidance on how organizations can make smart decisions. With the emergence from COVID-19 restrictions introduction of new training delivery methods and a stronger focus on effective training, this blog will further expand your knowledge on how to make the important decision of which conformity and compliance training organization is best for you as a professional and your organization.

## Key Factors to be considered

### Training Delivery Method

There are a variety of training methods available to choose from, namely micro-learning, self-paced/online learning, blended learning, face-to-face/classroom learning and virtual learning. With so many choices available it may appear confusing how to select which training delivery method works best for you. For us, the key question is micro-learning, self-paced/online learning is more suited to knowledge-based learning such as learning about a standard and/or regulatory requirement. If the aim is to acquire or enhance your auditor skills blended or face-to-face/classroom learning is arguably the best option. I confess I would never get on a plane, if I knew the pilot and engineer were trained solely in a knowledge based and/or self-taught learning class.

### Content Management

You should always check on the quality of the content and whether or not the content is simply a PowerPoint presentation with some notes or an instructionally and graphically designed learning materials and whether the learning materials are supplied to you on the first day of the learning event or whether you have access to the learning material at registration so you can review the learning material in advance of the learning event. Finally, you need to consider the currency and relevance of the learning content and whether you are receiving the very latest content, with the latest developments in the standard, regulation and best audit practices. This will generally be delivered if the Training Organization operates a learning management system that is independently verified by the Scheme Owner, such as CQI-IRCA, FSSC 22000, HACCP Alliance, Exemplar Global etc. or an ISO Certification Body/Registrar or Educational Establishment.

### Learning Consultant/Instructor

Not all Learning Consultants/Instructors are equal. Some Learning Consultants/Instructors have little or no background in learning or Education and do not actively participate in Continuous Professional Development. Some Learning Consultants/Instructors have little or no auditor experience, consulting or industry experience in the field, and of course some Learning Consultants/Instructors simple read the learning material as is and/or may lack the charisma to engage with different learner styles and learners of different abilities and support them to successfully complete the learning event or simply travel from one city to another city and delivery a stale and non-effective learning event.

### Certified Training

There are many organizations who deliver non-certified training. While this may meet your needs because you personally know the Consultant, or you are provided with self-paced online training that may have been developed by a reputed industry Expert, depending upon the learning objectives the claims made about the number of learners attending this training or the effectiveness of the learning the training may not be right for you in so far as it may not provide you with the skills to perform your role, it may not meet your ISO Certification Body/Registrar requirements in an external audit. The main advantages of Certified training from Scheme Owners such as CQI-IRCA, FSSC 22000, HACCP Alliance, Exemplar Global etc. is that you know the content, competence of the Learning Consultant/ Instructor and training organization has been independently and is routinely verified.

### Geographic/Industry Sector Coverage

Some training organizations are local, and a select few training organization’s provide international coverage and as a result the training organizations that provide international coverage generally employee Learning Consultants with a diverse culture background, have more industry sector and cultural expertise and can bring industry best practices and learnings into the live class. Some training organization’s claim to have international experience but, deliver very few trainings delivery Internationally and/or have no physical presence in the geographic region. If you and your organizations are seeking tailored training, it goes without saying you need to consider the industry sector expertise of the training organization and learning Consultant/Instructor delivering the learning event on your behalf.

### ISO/Regulatory Coverage

Some training organizations offer limited ISO and/or Regulatory schemes, e.g., ISO 9001, ISO 14001 or ISO 45001 training. Only a select number of other Training Organizations like the Kelmac Group® Academy offers a diverse range of courses and levels covering standards/regulations, auditor, advanced and specialized courses. Some training organizations may claim to offer a diverse range of ISO standards/regulatory training but upon closer examination they claim the course is under development, or they do not offer certified training.

### Independence

There is no doubt, the conformity and compliance industry are dominated by ISO Certification Bodies and Registrars. After all they have a captive client base as they provide ISO certification services to their audit clients. However, for many ISO certification Bodies/Registrars at best they offer their version of what the standards and/or regulations say as opposed to the best conformity and compliance practices, the training side of their business for them is simply a means to extract additional money from their existing clients and they generally offer a low quality customer service and/or the training side of their business is secondary to their main ISO certification/audit business. For the ISO Certification Bodies/registrars, their Learning Consultants/Instructors are rarely the most Expert personnel such as their Auditors.
