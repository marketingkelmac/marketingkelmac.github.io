This is the first in a series of educational blogs from the Kelmac GroupÒ Academy to help executives further their career, companies build their compliance infrastructure, and to increase the effectiveness of ISO and QMS implementations in every company. 

Corporations invest a great deal of resources in gaining and maintaining ISO certification.  They do this certainly to ensure regulatory compliance, but also to reduce risk, increase quality and marketplace competitiveness, The audit process is essential as it verifies to management that the systems and processes are in place, are being used as directed, and are achieving the desired results. 

**The internal auditor is the first line of defense**

The role of the ISO internal auditor is to confirm that the organization’s QMS is effective in delivering customer satisfaction, that the organization’s ISO documentation meets the requirements, and that day-to-day operations follow the objectives and guidelines contained in that documentation. It is essential that the internal auditor has an in-depth knowledge of the requirements and their implementation, as well as an objective, professional demeanor. 

The output of the internal auditor’s work would be an evaluation of the effectiveness of the organization’s internal controls, including recommendations regarding improvements, an assessment of compliance with the relevant policies and procedures, as well as compliance with state and federal laws, and contractual obligations. 

Internal auditors live in a world of risk. They are charged with helping organizations determine whether controls are in place to reduce risks in various processes and operations. They look for holes, inefficiencies, inconsistencies and regulatory compliance issues. 

**The lead auditor drives the auditing process**

An ISO Lead Auditor is a professional responsible for auditing an organization's management system by applying widely accepted auditing standards, procedures, principles, and techniques. This: 

Reduces an organization’s risk profile while enhancing integrity, quality, and profitability 
Designs and accomplishes audits per the appropriate ISO and/or QMS rules 
Develops a “sixth sense” for predicting and preventing non-compliance. 

The responsibilities of the ISO lead auditor include and build upon those of the internal auditor. Their unique charge is to: 

Lead and manage a team of internal auditor and their performance 
Oversee the audit process by assigning appropriate roles to the internal auditing team 
Ensure that audit reports are accurate, impartial, and contain recommendations for improvement
